<p>While it&#8217;s possible to write some software without knowing anything
about the underlying computer hardware, and there are good design
principles that state one should never make assumptions about the
computer hardware when writing software, there are still some basic
things about how computers work in general that a good programmer
needs to be aware of to write good code. Along those lines, the KSP
player writing a Kerboscript program needs to know a few basic things
about how the simulated kOS CPU operates in order to be able to write
more advanced scripts. This page contains that type of information.</p>

<p>Kerbal Space Program simulates the universe by running the universe in
small incremental time intervals that for the purpose of this
document, we will call &#8220;<strong>physics ticks</strong>&#8221;. The exact length of time
for a physics tick varies as the program runs. One physics tick might
take 0.09 seconds while the next one might take 0.085 seconds. (The
default setting for the rate of physics ticks is 25 ticks per second,
just to give a ballpark figure, but you <strong>must not</strong> write any scripts
that depend on this assumption because it&#8217;s a setting the user can
change, and it can also vary a bit during play depending on system
load. The setting is a target goal for the game to try to achieve, not
a guarantee. If it&#8217;s a fast computer with a speedy animation frame
rate, it will try to run physics ticks less often than it runs
animation frame updates, to try to make the physics tick rate match
this setting. On the other hand, If it&#8217;s a slow computer, it will try
to sacrifice animation frame rate to archive this number (meaning
physics get calculated faster than you can see the effects.)</p>
<p>When calculating physics formulas, you need to actually measure
elapsed time in the TIME:SECONDS variable in your scripts.</p>
<p>The entire simulated universe is utterly frozen during the duration of
a physics tick. For example, if one physics tick occurs at timestamp
10.51 seconds, and the next physics tick occurs 0.08 seconds later at
timestamp 10.59 seconds, then during the entire intervening time, at
timestamp 10.52 seconds, 10.53 seconds, and so on, nothing moves. The
clock is frozen at 10.51 seconds, and the fuel isn&#8217;t being consumed,
and the vessel is at the same position. On the next physics tick at
10.59 seconds, then all the numbers are updated.  The full details of
the physics ticks system are more complex than that, but that quick
description is enough to describe what you need to know about how
kOS&#8217;s CPU works.</p>
<p>There is another kind of time tick called an <strong>Update tick</strong>. It is
similar to, but different from, a <strong>physics tick</strong>. <em>Update ticks</em>
often occur a bit more often than <em>physics ticks</em>. Update ticks are
exactly the same thing as your game&#8217;s Frame Rate. Each time your game
renders another animation frame, it performs another Update tick. On a
good gaming computer with fast speed and a good graphics card, It is
typical to have about 2 or even 3 <em>Update ticks</em> happen within the
time it takes to have one <em>physics tick</em> happen. On a slower computer,
it is also possible to go the other way and have <em>Update ticks</em>
happening <em>less</em> frequently than <em>physics tics</em>. Basically, look at
your frame rate. Is it higher than 25 fps? If so, then your <em>update
ticks</em> happen faster than your <em>physics ticks</em>, otherwise its the
other way around.</p>
<p>It is important to note that versions of kOS prior to 0.17 executed program code during update ticks.  After that point, program code was executed during the physics ticks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="electric-drain">
<span id="electricdrain"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Electric Drain</a><a class="headerlink" href="#electric-drain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Real world CPUs often have low power modes, and sleep modes, and these are
vital to long distance probes.  In these modes the computer deliberately
runs slowly in order to use less power, and then the program can tell it to
speed up to normal speed again when it needs to wake up and do something.</p>
<p>Older versions of kOS implemented this concept with a constant electric drain regardless of CPU load.  As of version 0.19.0, this concept is simplified by just draining electric charge by &#8220;micropayments&#8221; of charge per instruction executed.</p>
<p>To change this setting if you want to re-balance the system, see the
page about <a class="reference internal" href="kospartmodule.html#ecperinstruction"><span>kOSProcessor part config values</span></a>.</p>
<p>The shorthand version is this:  The more instructions per update
actually get executed, the more power is drained.  This can be reduced
by either lowering <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CONFIG:IPU</span></code> or by making sure your main loop
has a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> statement in it.  (When encountering a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> statement,
the remainder of the instructions for that update are not used and end
up not counting against electric charge).</p>
<p>The system always costs at least 1 instruction of electric charge per
update no matter what the CPU is doing, unless it&#8217;s powered down entirely,
because there&#8217;s always at least 1 instruction just to check if it&#8217;s time
to resume yet in a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code>.  The electric cost is never entirely zero
as long as it&#8217;s turned on, but it can be very close to zero while it is
stuck on a wait.</p>
<p>If your program spins in a busy loop, never waiting, it can consume
quite a bit more power than it would if you explicitly throw in a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span> <span class="pre">0.001.</span></code> in the loop.  Even if the wait is very small, the
mere fact that it yields the remaining instructions still allowed
that update can make a big difference.</p>

<div class="section" id="triggers">
<span id="id1"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Triggers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#triggers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple things within kerboscript that run &#8220;in the background&#8221;
always updating, while the main script continues on. The way these work is
a bit like a real computer&#8217;s interrupt handling system, but not <em>quite</em>.</p>
<p>Collectively all of these things are called &#8220;triggers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Triggers come in these varieties:</p>
<ul class="simple" id="recurring-trigger">
<li><strong>Recurring triggers:</strong> Triggers that once they are started keep getting
called again and again on a regular basis, until they are made to stop.<ul>
<li>LOCKS which are attached to flight controls (THROTTLE, STEERING,
etc), but not other LOCKS.</li>
<li>User Delegates assigned to recurrently updating suffixes such as
<a class="reference internal" href="../structures/misc/vecdraw.html#attribute:VECDRAW:VECUPDATER" title="VECDRAW:VECUPDATER attribute"><code class="xref ks ks-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">VecDraw:VECUPDATER</span></code></a>.</li>
<li>WHEN and ON triggers:<ul>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEN</span> <span class="pre">condition</span> <span class="pre">THEN</span> <span class="pre">{</span> <span class="pre">some</span> <span class="pre">commands</span> <span class="pre">}</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">condition</span> <span class="pre">{</span> <span class="pre">some</span> <span class="pre">commands</span> <span class="pre">}</span></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" id="callback-once-trigger">
<li><strong>CallbackOnce triggers:</strong> Triggers that only happen once per event.  To
make the trigger happen again, the event has to happen again:<ul>
<li>Callback delegates you tell the system to call when the user
performs GUI events (for example a button&#8217;s ONCLICK).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two types of trigger don&#8217;t have the same priority level.
It is possible for a recurring trigger to interrupt a callback-once
trigger, but not the other way around.  Further information about
this is described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#interrupt-priority"><span>interrupt priority</span></a>
documentation below.</p>
<p>All triggers work essentially like this:</p>
<p>The kOS CPU decides it&#8217;s time to cause a call to the trigger.  (How it
does this is explained below in
<a class="reference internal" href="#interrupt-priority"><span>interrupt priority</span></a>.)  Once it decides its
time to call the trigger, it does so by inserting a subroutine call
at the current moment that interrupts the normal program flow and
jumps to the trigger&#8217;s subroutine <em>as if</em> the program itself had chosen
to call the subroutine.  It manipulates the call-stack in such a way
that the normal work of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Return</span></code> instruction at the end of the
trigger routine will pop back to the current location of the program
flow.  This system works because all variables in kOS are on the
stack without any registers, and so popping back to where the
interruption happened puts everything back in the state it was in
before the interruption so the program can continue as if nothing
had happened.</p>
<p>Prior to kOS 0.19.3, this section was quite different but large changes to how triggers work required a re-write of this whole page. Any old kOS scripts you find that were written prior to kOS 0.19.3 that used triggers might have different behaviour because of this.</p>
<div class="section" id="triggers-for-cooked-steering">
<span id="trigger-steering"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Triggers for Cooked Steering</a><a class="headerlink" href="#triggers-for-cooked-steering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>This is a kind of</em> <a class="reference internal" href="#recurring-trigger"><span>recurring trigger</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lock</span></code> expressions associated with <a class="reference internal" href="../commands/flight/cooked.html#cooked"><span>Cooked Control</span></a>,
meaning <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">STEERING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">THROTTLE</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEELSTEERING</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEELTHROTTLE</span></code>, have triggers associated with them.
kOS will keep calling these expressions repeatedly as frequently
as it can (once per <strong>physics tick</strong> if it can).  That is why
they are a kind of <em>recurring_trigger</em>.</p>
<p>Note, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></code> command does not <em>normally</em> result in a trigger
that runs every <strong>physics tick</strong>.  It just does this when dealing with
one of these specific values, of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">STEERING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">THROTTLE</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEELSTEERING</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEELTHROTTLE</span></code>.  The normal behaviour of
a lock expression is to only execute the expression when it&#8217;s used
inside another expression.  It&#8217;s just that in the case of these
special locks, the kOS system <em>itself</em> is repeatedly doing that.
To do this kOS needs to interrupt whatever your code was doing at the
time to perform this expression and it uses the trigger interrupt
system to do so.</p>

<div class="section" id="triggers-for-when-and-on-statements">
<span id="when-on-trigger"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Triggers for WHEN and ON statements</a><a class="headerlink" href="#triggers-for-when-and-on-statements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>This is a kind of</em> <a class="reference internal" href="#recurring-trigger"><span>recurring trigger</span></a>.</p>
<p>Each of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ON</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEN</span></code> triggers also behave
much like a function, with a body like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nv">conditional_expression</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nv">do_rest_of_trigger_body_here</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p id="when-on-conditional"><strong>WHEN and ON Triggers always interrupt to check the condition even when
the body doesn&#8217;t happen yet.</strong></p>
<p>Even a trigger who&#8217;s condition isn&#8217;t true yet still needs to execute
the few instructions at the start of the trigger that <em>discover</em> that
its condition isn&#8217;t true yet.  The trigger causes a subroutine call
once per <strong>physics tick</strong> (or less often if the system has too
much trigger work to accomplish all the triggers in one tick).
This call gets at least far enough into the routine to
reach the conditional expression check and discover that it&#8217;s not
time to run the rest of the body yet, so it returns.  An expensive
to calculate conditional expression can really starve the system of
instructions because the system is attempting to run it every
<strong>physics tick</strong> if it can.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s good practice to try to keep your trigger&#8217;s conditional check
short and fast to execute.  If it consists of multiple clauses, try
to take advantage of</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../language/features.html#short-circuit"><span>short circuit boolean</span></a>
<em>logic by putting the fastest part of the check first.</em></p>

<div class="section" id="triggers-for-gui-callbacks">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Triggers for GUI callbacks</a><a class="headerlink" href="#triggers-for-gui-callbacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another type of trigger is the callback delegates that you can
write for the <a class="reference internal" href="../structures/gui.html#gui"><span>GUI system</span></a> when using the
<a class="reference internal" href="../structures/gui.html#gui-callback-technique"><span>Callback technique</span></a>.  (For example,
using <a class="reference internal" href="../structures/gui_widgets/button.html#attribute:BUTTON:ONCLICK" title="BUTTON:ONCLICK attribute"><code class="xref ks ks-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">Button:ONCLICK</span></code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../structures/gui_widgets/slider.html#attribute:SLIDER:ONCHANGE" title="SLIDER:ONCHANGE attribute"><code class="xref ks ks-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">Slider:ONCHANGE</span></code></a>, and so on.)</p>
<p>When you give a GUI a callback hook to call, the CPU will implement
that as a trigger as well.  When you click the button or move the
slider, etc, then kOS will interrupt your program at the next available
opportunity (usually the start of the next IPU&#8217;s worth of instructions),
to call your callback delegate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wait-in-a-trigger">
<span id="wait-in-trigger"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Wait in a Trigger</a><a class="headerlink" href="#wait-in-a-trigger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> is possible from inside a trigger and it won&#8217;t crash
the script to use it, it&#8217;s probably not a good design choice to use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> inside a trigger.  Triggers should be designed to execute
all the way through to the end in one fast pass, if possible.</p>
<p>Exception: If you are careful, there is a built-in function you
can call that will have your trigger willingly relinquish its priority
increase, reducing it back down to whatever the priority was before
it rudely interrupted things. Doing that can allow other triggers of
equal priority to itself to interrupt it again.  To see how this works,
look at <a class="reference internal" href="#function:DROPPRIORITY" title="DROPPRIORITY function"><code class="xref ks ks-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY()</span></code></a>, explained below on this page.  In general,
however, it&#8217;s a better idea not to use this unless you fully understand
how the prioriy system here works.</p>

<p>For similar reasons to the explanation above about the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> command
used inside triggers, it&#8217;s not really a good idea for a trigger to
have a long loop inside it that just keeps going and going.</p>
<p>The system does allow a trigger to take more than one <strong>physics tick</strong>
to finish.  There are cases where it is entirely legitimate to do so
if the trigger&#8217;s body has too much work to do to get it all done in one
update.  However, all triggers should be designed to finish their tasks
in finite time and return.  What you should not do is design a trigger&#8217;s
body to go into an infinite loop, or a long-lasting loop that you thought
would run in the background while the rest of the program continues on.</p>
<p>This is because while you are in a trigger, main-line code isn&#8217;t being
executed, and other triggers of equal or lesser priority aren&#8217;t being
executed.  A trigger that performs a long-running loop will starve the
rest of the code in your kerboscript program from being allowed to run.</p>
<p>Exception: If you are careful, there is a built-in function you
can call that will have your trigger willingly relinquish its priority
increase, reducing it back down to whatever the priority was before
it rudely interrupted things. Doing that can allow other triggers of
equal priority to itself to interrupt it again.  To see how this works,
look at <a class="reference internal" href="#function:DROPPRIORITY" title="DROPPRIORITY function"><code class="xref ks ks-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY()</span></code></a>, explained below on this page.  In general,
however, it&#8217;s a better idea not to use this unless you fully understand
how the prioriy system here works.</p>

<p>If you want a trigger body that is meant to loop a long time, the only
workable way to do it is to design it to execute just once, but
then make it return true (or use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preserve</span></code> keyword, which is
basically the same thing) to keep the trigger around for the next
<strong>physics tick</strong>. Thus your trigger becomes a sort of &#8220;loop&#8221; that
executes one iteration per <strong>physics tick</strong>.</p>

<span id="interrupt-priority"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Trigger Interrupt Priority</a><a class="headerlink" href="#trigger-interrupt-priority" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="versionadded">
<p><span class="versionmodified">New in version 1.1.6.0: </span>The multiple priorities of interruption described below (GUI callbacks
being lower priority than recurring callbacks) were introduced in
kOS v1.1.6.0</p>
</div>
<p>When the CPU wants to interrupt the normal program flow and redirect it
into a trigger, there are some priority rules for which kind of trigger
is allowed to interrupt the program flow depending on what the program
is doing right now.  This is accomplished by having a few priority
levels, shown in this list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Priority 30: <a class="reference internal" href="#trigger-steering"><span>Cooked control Interrupts</span></a> (i.e. LOCK STEERING)</li>
<li>Priority 20: <a class="reference internal" href="#recurring-trigger"><span>Recurring Interrupts</span></a> (i.e. WHEN or ON)</li>
<li>Priority 10: <a class="reference internal" href="#callback-once-trigger"><span>Callback-Once Interrupts</span></a> (i.e. GUI callbacks)</li>
<li>Priority 0: Normal (non-interrupting) code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Trigger will only interrupt something of lower priority than itself</strong>.</p>
<p>If the CPU is currently running normal non-interrupting) code, then any
trigger is allowed to interrupt it.  But if it is currently already in
the middle of running a trigger, and another trigger of equal priority
wants to interrupt it, the second trigger will wait until the first
trigger is over and the CPU has dropped back down to normal code
before the second trigger will be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>The reason the priorities are laid out the way they are is that
the assumption is that recurring interrupts need to be the
highest priority because they&#8217;re often time sensitive and need
to happen again and again with speed, while the callback-once
interrupts are probably not as time-sensitive since they respond
to one-shot events like user clicks.</p>
<p><strong>most triggers cannot interrupt *themselves* if they&#8217;re still running</strong>.</p>
<p>When you have recurring triggers that keep re-running themselves
again and again, the way they work is that they wait till the previous
instance of themselves has finished running before a new instance will
happen.  Thus a recurring trigger will <em>not</em> run every single <strong>physics
tick</strong> if the trigger takes longer than 1 tick to finish.  Instead it
will wait for the start of the next <strong>physics tick</strong> <em>after</em> the current
execution of the trigger is over.  (This is to prevent it from queuing
up calls faster than they get dispatched, which would make a backlog.)</p>
<p>These priorities are subject to change in later future versions of
kOS.  Right now they&#8217;re pretty coarse-grain, which is why they count
by 10&#8217;s - so there is room to split them up and make them more
fine-grained if that becomes necessary later.  Never write code that
is too dependant on the priorities being exactly this way.  (This is
why these numbers aren&#8217;t even exposed to the script at the moment,
to avoid that design pattern.)</p>

<p>It would mean that while you press the &#8220;count&#8221; button, and it prints the
countdown from 5 to 1, the other buttons, including &#8220;beep&#8221; and &#8220;quit&#8221;
would have no effect until the countdown is done.  Because <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count()</span></code>
is the callback for a GUI button, it runs at a higher than normal priority,
which means it won&#8217;t let itself get interrupted by other GUI callbacks.
Instead those other GUI callbacks will be delayed until count() is done.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can cause your trigger, or callback, to deliberately
relinquish its hold on other interrupts, allowing them to interrupt it
despite the fact that it is itself in the middle of an interrupt.
You do this by  deliberately reducing your current priority level
back down a step to whatever it was prior to being incresed by the
interrrupt, which is what this special built-in function does:</p>
<dl class="function">
<dt id="function:DROPPRIORITY">
<code class="descname">DROPPRIORITY</code><span class="sig-paren">(</span><span class="sig-paren">)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#function:DROPPRIORITY" title="Permalink to this definition">¶</a></dt>
<dd><p>After this built-in function is executed by a trigger&#8217;s body,
the current interrupt priority is dropped back down to whatever the
priority of the code you interrupted was.  This is your trigger&#8217;s
way of saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t actually want to block interrupts anymore.
Please let me be interrupted just as much as whatever <em>I</em>
interrupted was allowed to be interrupted.&#8221;</p>
<p>SO, for example, if Priority 0 code (normal code) got interrupted
by priority 10 code (GUI callback code), and the GUI callback
code executed <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY</span></code>, then it would now be running at
priority 0 instead of 10, because priority 0 is what got interrupted,
and thus allow other GUI code to interrupt it again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if GUI callback code (priority 10) got
interrupted by WHEN-THEN code (priority 20), and the WHEN-THEN
code had called DROPPRIORITY(), then the priority level of
that pass through the WHEN-THEN would only be dropped down to
10, NOT all the way to 0, because it was interrupting priority 10
code.</p>
<p>The reason it works this way (instead of just dropping it all the
way down to normal (0) priority directly) is that, effectively,
it means a trigger only has the authority to undo its own
priority increase that it caused itself.  It can&#8217;t force the
priority down to something less than the code that got interrupted
had to begin with.  Had it been allowed to do that, it could have
been a back-door to circumventing the priority of the thing
that it interrupted.</p>
<p>Be aware that once you <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY()</span></code>, you also are making it
so that the SAME trigger you are currently inside of could fire off
again too.  It may be a good idea to protect yourself against that,
if it is not desired, by setting a flag variable to record the fact
that you are inside the trigger at the time and should not re-run it,
and then test this flag variable at the top of your trigger code,
skipping the body if it&#8217;s set.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>So in the above GUI example, if you added <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY</span></code> as shown
in the edited version of the example, below, then the other buttons
like the &#8220;beep&#8221; button, would work while the count() is happening:</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you call <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY()</span></code>, then from then on, you are effectively no
longer a trigger, as far as the interruption system is concerned.</p>
<p>BE CAREFUL - if you do this then it is possible for the same trigger or
callback to interrupt <em>itself</em> again.  In the above example where
DROPPRIORITY() was added, you could press the &#8220;count&#8221; button twice in
quick succession and one press would interrupt the other.  It&#8217;s up to you,
if you use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY()</span></code> to deal with this problem and stop it from
happening if it&#8217;s a bad thing for your program.  You can do this by
setting a flag that checks if your trigger is already running and if so,
skips it, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">local</span> <span class="nv">count_is_running</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">.</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Again, using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DROPPRIORITY()</span></code> is an advanced topic that should be avoided
until after you understand what you&#8217;ve read here.  Even then, it&#8217;s usually
simpler and better to just avoid using it and instead design your script in
such a way that it&#8217;s unnecessary to use it.  (It&#8217;s only necessary to use it
if you have interrupt triggers that run a long time instead of finishing
quickly like they should.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wait">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Wait!!!</a><a class="headerlink" href="#wait" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any WAIT statement causes the kerboscript program to immediately stop executing the main program where it is, even if far fewer than <a class="reference internal" href="../structures/misc/config.html#attribute:CONFIG:IPU" title="CONFIG:IPU attribute"><code class="xref ks ks-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">Config:IPU</span></code></a> instructions have been executed in this <strong>physics tick</strong>. It will not continue the execution until at least the next <strong>physics tick</strong>, when it will check to see if the WAIT condition is satisfied and it&#8217;s time to wake up and continue.</p>
<p>Therefore ANY WAIT of any kind will guarantee that your program will allow at least one <strong>physics tick</strong> to have happened before continuing. If you attempt to:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">WAIT</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mf">001</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But the duration of the next physics tick is actually 0.09 seconds, then you will actually end up waiting at least 0.09 seconds. It is impossible to wait a unit of time smaller than one physics tick. Using a very small unit of time in a WAIT statement is an effective way to force the CPU to allow a physics tick to occur before continuing to the next line of code.
In fact, you can just tell it to wait &#8220;zero&#8221; seconds and it will still
really wait the full length of a <strong>physics tick</strong>.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">WAIT</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Ends up being effectively the same thing as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span> <span class="pre">0.01.</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span> <span class="pre">0.001.</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span> <span class="pre">0.000001.</span></code>.  Since they all contain a
time less than a <strong>physics tick</strong>, they all &#8220;round up&#8221; to waiting a
full <strong>physics tick</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you just say:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">WAIT</span> <span class="k">UNTIL</span> <span class="nb">TRUE</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then even though the condition is immediately true, it will still wait one physics tick to discover this fact and continue.</p>

pointer set to the current instruction pointer, and its &#8220;came from&#8221;
priority level set to the current priority level.</li>
<li>Push that subroutine context record on the callstack just like a normal
subroutine call would do.</li>
<li>Set the instruction pointer to the first instruction of the trigger&#8217;s
code.</li>
<li>Change the CPU priority to match the new priority of the interrupt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if it just lets the CPU loop run as normal after that, it will be
inside the trigger code, and when it reaches the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Return</span></code> instruction at
the end of the trigger code, it will pop the context record off the call
stack and end up back where it was now before the interruption happened.
Not only does <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Return</span></code> go back to the instruction the call came from,
but it also drops back down to the priority level the call came from.</p>
<p>Because the kOS CPU is a pure stack machine, with all variables and
scopes stored on the stack, this ensures everything will be just like
it was before the interruption, and the main code can continue on,
unaware that it was even interrupted.</p>

<h4>Interrupts that happen at the same time<a class="headerlink" href="#interrupts-that-happen-at-the-same-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When more than one trigger of the same priority are in the queue and both
try to interrupt at the same time before either one has started running,
then what happens is this:  The first trigger gets its interrupt to occur,
but the second trigger, because the first trigger raised the priority
level of the CPU, will refuse to interrupt the first one... UNTIL
the first one gets to the bottom and does its <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Return</span></code>.  Then before
executing the next normal priority instruction, the CPU hits point 3.3 in
the loop above again with the priority level now reduced back to normal
because the first trigger has returned, and right away it notices the
second trigger still in the queue, and inserts a call to it before the
main code can continue.</p>
<p>Thus the two interrupts happen back to back before normal code continues.</p>
<p>Note that the number of instructions being executed (CONFIG:IPU) are NOT lines of code or kerboscript statements, but rather the smaller instruction opcodes that they are compiled into behind the scenes. A single kerboscript statement might become anywhere from one to ten or so instructions when compiled.</p>

<p>Each <strong>physics</strong> <em>tick</em>, the kOS mod wakes up and runs through all the currently loaded CPU parts that are in &#8220;physics range&#8221; (i.e. 2.5 km), and executes a batch of instructions from your script code that&#8217;s on them. It is important to note that during the running of this batch of instructions, because no <strong>physics ticks</strong> are happening during it, none of the values that you might query from the KSP system will change. The clock time returned from the TIME variable will keep the same value throughout. The amount of fuel left will remain fixed throughout. The position and velocity of the vessel will remaining fixed throughout. It&#8217;s not until the next physics tick occurs that those values will change to new numbers. It&#8217;s typical that several lines of your kerboscript code will run during a single physics tick.</p>
<p>Effectively, as far as the <em>simulated</em> universe can tell, it&#8217;s as if your script runs several instructions in literally zero amount of time, and then pauses for a fraction of a second, and then runs more instructions in literally zero amount of time, then pauses for a fraction of a second, and so on, rather than running the program in a smoothed out continuous way.</p>
<p>This is a vital difference between how a kOS CPU behaves versus how a real world computer behaves. In a real world computer, you would know for certain that time will pass, even if it&#8217;s just a few picoseconds, between the execution of one statement and the next.</p>
